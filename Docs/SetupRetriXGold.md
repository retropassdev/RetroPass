# RetriX Gold

## Setup with LaunchBox

 1. Open LaunchBox
 2. Go to **Tools -> Manage... -> Emulators**
 3. Click **Add** to add an emulator. Don't worry about the Application Path parameter. It's enough to just input RetriX.UWP.exe

 4. Click **Associated Platforms**, and make sure "Default Emulator" checkbox is checked for platforms which should be started with RetriX Gold. If "Default Emulator" is not checked, then RetroArch is used instead.
